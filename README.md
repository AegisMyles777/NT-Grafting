A mod for the game Barotrauma

A Neurotrauma extension mod for taking the limbs and organs from the creatures of Europa and grafting them onto yourself. Experience the benefits of the creatures you fight, and with them, the difficulties that come from mixing DNA.
There are currently 21 different grafting procedures that can be done.

This mod must be loaded above NT and any mod that tries to override vanilla creatures. If this does not happen, it is likely that the creatures will not drop any grafting items, making this useless.

A guide for how to properly graft as a medic is here:

This mod has not yet been properly balanced. All factors such as item fabrication costs, difficulty to graft, benefits of grafts, price of transplants, and many more have not yet been properly fine tuned. As such, any feedback about the mods balancing is appreciated.


Current patches:

-Baroverhaul: Patches the talent tree, allowing for both Baroverhaul talents and NT Grafting talents, as well as takes the Baroverhaul modifications of some creatures and adds NT Grafting drops to them.

If you use the NT Eyes extension, all eye afflictions from this mod will be unobtainable.


THIS MOD IS BLEEDING EDGE, EXPECT ISSUES EARLY ON
This mod will not perfectly work with any other mod that adds unique new organs. More patches can be expected for the future to remedy this current issue.

Updates will likely slow, as I am becoming more busy.


Please report any bugs found. I will try to fix what I can.


Many organ assets and the scalpel assets were taken and modified from original Neurotrauma, thank you for the art.


This mod took a large amount of time and dedication to properly develop. If you enjoy the mod, and want to support me for the time it took to develop, please consider donating to the bitcoin wallet below:
